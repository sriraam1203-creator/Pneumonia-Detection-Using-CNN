 Overview:

Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that requires early and accurate diagnosis. This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images, helping doctors make faster and more consistent diagnostic decisions.

 Problem Statement:

Manual chest X-ray analysis can be time-consuming and may vary between experts. The goal of this project is to build an automated CNN-based system that classifies X-ray images as Normal or Pneumonia, improving diagnostic efficiency and accessibility.

Objectives:

Build a CNN model for pneumonia detection

Preprocess and normalize X-ray images

Train and evaluate the model using performance metrics

Ensure good generalization on unseen data

 Methodology

Collect chest X-ray dataset

Apply image preprocessing and augmentation

Design and train a CNN architecture

Evaluate model performance using accuracy and loss

🛠️Technologies Used:

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

OpenCV

Matplotlib

Results:

The CNN model achieved promising accuracy in detecting pneumonia and shows potential as a clinical decision-support tool.
